A compute shader implemented in Apple's Metal

This project took longer than I expected. My plan was to implement a compute shader version of the GPGPU project I implemented for my presentation. Unfortunately, I struggled more with the swift, and Mac app aspects of the program, than the Metal parts. I pieced together this assignment from what I could glean about compute shaders from the book Metal By Example, which is written in Objective-C, and the presentation here https://realm.io/news/swift-summit-simon-gladman-metal/. I used a smaller number of particles so it looks more "normal", although since it is capable of handling considerably more particles than my GPGPU version.
